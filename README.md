# Rate Caster: A Trust-Oriented Social Dapp Rating System 

## Introduction

Rate Caster is a decentralized application (Dapp) built on the Base blockchain, designed to enhance transparency and trust within the Web3 ecosystem while supporting its growth. It enables users to rate and review decentralized applications, fostering a community-driven reputation system that helps users make informed decisions about which Dapps to trust and use. It is designed to be compatible with Warpcaster, allowing users to review and rate apps within it. Currently, user reviews are mapped to their wallets, with plans to integrate Farcaster IDs in the future to see real user reviews instead of just public keys.

## Why Rate Caster?

The Web3 space is rapidly growing with numerous Dapps available to users. However, this vast array often leaves users overwhelmed and uncertain about the security, reliability, and trustworthiness of these applications. Rate Caster addresses this challenge by leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), providing a platform where community feedback determines the trustworthiness of Dapps. This feedback loop, combined with EAS's secure and verifiable attestations, empowers developers to refine and enhance their offerings based on real user experiences and insights.

## Features

### Warpcaster Integration
- Users can view popular Dapps inside the chat frame and provide reviews to the apps all within Warpcaster.

### Website Features
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of registered Dapps along with their community ratings. Users can search and filter through the list to find applications of interest.
- **Dapp Registration**: Allows users to register new Dapps on the platform, ensuring the database is continually updated with the latest applications.
- **Dapp Rating and Reviews**: Users can leave detailed reviews and rate Dapps, contributing to the overall trust score of each application.
- **My Reviews**: Users can view and manage their review history, with options to update or delete their past contributions.

## Future Directions

We believe in decentralized social applications and will focus on integrating and mapping Farcaster IDs to reviews so that we can display Warpcaster profiles attached to the reviews on the website. Our current focus is on promoting and displaying Farcaster Ecosystem projects within the Warpcaster Frame. With the growth of the Farcaster community, Rate Caster will help newcomers find the most useful and trusted applications through Rate Caster.
